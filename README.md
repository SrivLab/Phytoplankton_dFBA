# Phytoplankton_dFBA

Simulation code and relevant data for "Open-ocean Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis of Arctic Diatom Life Cycle".

Main simulation files for diatom-only, symbiosis-only, and the succession simulations are included in the main branch.

Core functions for dFBA and handling light intensity and calculations which handle the day/night cycle are included in "dFBA Functions".
All genome-scale metabolic models used within the simulations are included in "Models".

In the "Data" branch, all necessary data including sea-surface temperature, light intensity calculation parameters are provided.
